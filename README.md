Institutional Advancement landing page for UTA

During my time at UTA as a Web Developer, the department I worked under was in the middle of an identity re-brand. Formerly called University Advancement, the department went through a name change to Institutional Advancement and didn't have a formal way of communicating the name change, services we include and how that will impact the rest of campus.

Utilized Flexbox, the pre-defined styles within the Omega master stylesheet, custom Foundation framework and was given 1 week to turn around for review/publication.
